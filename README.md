# Language models
This repository hosts Python implementations of three different types of language models:
Bigram Model, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Model, and WaveNet Model. 
These implementations were based on Andrej Karpathy's YouTube series available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ)
